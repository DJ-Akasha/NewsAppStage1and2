# NewsAppS1

Udacity Android Basics course project 6 News App stage 1. Learning to connect to an API and show the results of the query in the app.

This is my second attempt after I broke the first one. I broke it trying to use Picasso for loading images. Ended up deleting something by mistake
and then not being able to undo it. Everything stopped working. Tried to salvage it but after an hour I just started again.

So this version loads images and also adds the author info and the bodyTextSummary.
